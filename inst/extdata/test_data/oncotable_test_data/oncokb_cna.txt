CDK6 amplification is known to be oncogenic.				CDK6 overexpression is the biological consequence of diverse genomic alternations, including CDK6 gene amplification (PMID: 17989712, 22476749), translocation events involving CDK6 locus (PMID: 11940479, 19145199, 23127611, 12900351) and aberrant transcriptional activation driven by other oncogenic fusion events (e.g. MLL rearrangements, PMID: 24736461, 24764564). CDK6 expression promotes proliferation, transformation, and tumorigenicity of p16INK4a/Arf-null astrocytes, suggesting an oncogenic role played by CDK6 in glioblastoma development (PMID: 20534551). CDK6 knockdown experiments demonstrated that CDK6 is the major regulator of cellular proliferation in MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, hence suggesting that up-regulation of CDK6 expression may be a tumor-promoting event in leukemia (PMID: 24736461, 24764564). Mechanistically, it is believed that the increased availability of CDK6 results in the formation of CDK4/6-cyclin D complexes that are able to overcome p16-mediated inhibition and lead to cell cycle progression.	7	Oncogene

Deletion of CDKN2A results in loss of the p16/INK4A and p14/ARF proteins. CDKN2A deletion has been found in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, glioma, bladder carcinoma, leukemia and melanoma and is often associated with poorer clinical outcomes (PMID: 15495191, 26516359, 10999737). Deletion of CDKN2A in mouse models of malignant mesothelioma resulted in accelerated tumorigenesis compared to wildtype (PMID: 21526190). In addition, knockdown of CDKN2A in an HRAS G12V mouse model resulted in the induction of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (PMID: 28982163).	0	Tumor Suppressor

MET amplification is known to be oncogenic.				MET amplification results from the gain of the MET gene on chromosome 7q31 and is found in various cancers, including melanoma, lung and renal cancers (PMID: 28481359). Often, this amplification leads to overexpression of the MET protein, which has been demonstrated to contribute to tumorigenesis by increasing downstream pathway activation, proliferation, invasiveness, and angiogenesis (PMID: 16461907, 18077425, 17463250, 19117057, 22869872,17667909). MET amplification has also been shown to contribute to resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including gefitinib and erlotinib and more recently osimertinib, as shown by sustained pathway activation and proliferation in the presence of drug (PMID: 18093943, 17463250, 30073261). In vitro proliferation assays of cell lines with MET amplifications show sensitivity to the MET-specific kinase inhibitor, PHA-665752 (PMID: 17463250, 16461907).	25	Oncogene

SMAD4 is frequently mutated in pancreatic and colorectal cancer and infrequently mutated in various other cancers.	SMAD4 deletion is likely oncogenic.				SMAD4 deletions gives rise to pleiotropic and and tissue-dependent effects in tumorigenesis as demonstrated in different model systems (PMID: 22321641, 22321641, 17114584, 9482899, 10773876, 9506519, 10626800). For example SMAD4 deletions promote metastasis in pancreatic cancer but is not sufficient to initiate tumor formation; in contrast, these alterations are sufficient to promote tumor progression and initiation in head and neck cancer. Additionally, in transgenic mouse models of head and neck cancer and lung cancer, deletion of SMAD4 results in increased genomic instability and tumor development (PMID: 19841536, 25893305). In colon cancer cell lines, depletion of SMAD4 results in abrogation of TGF-mediated growth inhibition (PMID: 9482899).	0	Tumor Suppressor
